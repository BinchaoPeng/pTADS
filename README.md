# pTADS
a method(prediction of TAD boundary and strength) to evaluate the performance of histone and transcription factor information in predicting the TAD boundaries across multiple cell lines. The pTADS method is consisted of random forest models to predict the TAD boundary and lasso based boundary score to characterize the TAD boundary strength
